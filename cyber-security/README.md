## Cybersecurity Portfolio Projects

###Throughout the Google certificate program, I developed items to include in my portfolio. These portfolio items include:

- A professional statement.
- A security audit (i.e., a controls and compliance checklist).
- An incident report analysis (i.e., analyzing network structure and security).
- The use of Linux commands to manage file permissions.
- The application of filters to SQL queries.
- A vulnerability assessment report (i.e., the identification of vulnerabilities for a small business).
- An incident handlerâ€™s journal
- The use of Python programming language to import and parse a text file in a security-related scenario.
- A resume
