Thus, it is imperative to minimize false negatives because a claim that is misclassified as an opinion does not get reviewed when it violates the terms of service whereas an opinion misclassified as a claim goes to human review.\n",

If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion.\n"
