## Google Advanced Data Analytics Portfolio Capstone Project

### Project Title: Salifort Motors Classification Project. Employee Retention Prediction.

### Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee will leave Salifort Motors, helping the company improve employee retention. The data team utilized random forest and XGBoost models to cross-compare results and selected the random forest model for its high predictive power.

### Business Understanding
Salifort Motors leadership and HR department seek to understand employee behavior and enhance retention efforts. By predicting employee turnover, the company can take proactive measures to address factors contributing to attrition.

### Data Understanding
The data team analyzed employee data, identifying trends such as overwork leading to increased turnover. Further investigation revealed lower retention rates in sales, technical, and support departments. Insights from the data guided the development of the machine learning models.

### Modeling and Evaluation
Two machine learning models, random forest and XGBoost, were developed and evaluated. The random forest model demonstrated high predictive power, accurately predicting true negatives and true positives with minimal false negatives or false positives. Fine-tuning and exploring other algorithms may further enhance model performance.

### Conclusion
The successful development of a predictive model for employee retention at Salifort Motors provides a valuable tool for the company to make data-driven decisions and improve retention strategies. Continuous feedback and iteration with the HR department can ensure the model remains effective in predicting turnover and supporting employee retention efforts.
