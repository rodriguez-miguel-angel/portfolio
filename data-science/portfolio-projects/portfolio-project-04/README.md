## Google Advanced Data Analytics Portfolio Project-04

### Project Title: TikTok Claims Classification Project. Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing. 

### Project Overview:
This project focuses on conducting hypothesis testing on the TikTok user claim dataset to determine the relationship between the variables 'verified_status' and 'video_view_count'. The goal is to understand how the verification status of a video may impact its view count on TikTok and provide valuable insights for the claims classification project.

### Business Understanding:
TikTok is working on developing a predictive model to efficiently prioritize user reports by determining if a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. By analyzing the relationship between 'verified_status' and 'video_view_count', TikTok aims to enhance decision-making processes related to claims classification and improve the overall user experience.

### Data Understanding:
The dataset contains information on the verification status of videos ('verified_status') and their corresponding view counts ('video_view_count'). Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the distribution of data and identify any patterns or trends that may exist between the variables.

### Modeling and Evaluation:
A two-sample hypothesis test is conducted to compare the mean values of view counts for verified and unverified videos. The null hypothesis assumes no difference in view counts, while the alternative hypothesis suggests a difference. By calculating the p-value at a significance level of 5%, the team can determine the statistical significance of the relationship between verification status and view count.

### Conclusion:
The results of the hypothesis test will provide insights into how the verification status of a video influences its view count on TikTok. These findings will inform decision-making processes within TikTok and contribute to the development of the claims classification project. The project aims to optimize the prioritization of user reports and enhance the overall user experience on the platform.
