## Google Advanced Data Analytics Portfolio Project-05

### Project Title: TikTok Claims Classification Project. Logistic Regression Model. 

### Project Overview
In this project, the TikTok data team is working on developing a logistic regression model to classify user submissions as verified or not verified. The goal is to reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

### Business Understanding
TikTok receives a large number of user reports that need to be reviewed by moderators. By developing a predictive model, TikTok aims to automate the process of identifying videos that contain claims or opinions, thus improving the efficiency of content moderation.

### Data Understanding
The data team is using the variable of verified_status to build the logistic regression model. The logistic regression model is chosen based on the type and distribution of the provided data set. It is based on the relationship between verified account types and video content features, such as video duration. 

### Modeling and Evaluation
The logistic regression model achieved a precision of 63%, a recall of 83.9%, an f1-score of 72%, and an accuracy of 67%. The model's performance metrics indicate that it is performing reasonably well in predicting the target class of "not verified". The variable 'video_duration_sec' has a significant impact on the likelihood of a user having a verified status.

### Conclusion
The TikTok data team has made significant progress in developing the logistic regression model for the claims classification project. By leveraging the insights from the model, TikTok can prioritize user reports more effectively and reduce the backlog of content moderation tasks.
