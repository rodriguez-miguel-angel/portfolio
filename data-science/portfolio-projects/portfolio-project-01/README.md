## Google Advanced Data Analytics Portfolio Project-01

### Project Title: TikTok Claims Classification Project

### Project Overview:
The TikTok Claims Classification Project aims to develop a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. By successfully predicting this, TikTok can efficiently reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more effectively. This end-of-course project provides an opportunity for data analysts to practice and apply their skills in data analysis.

### Business Understanding:
At TikTok, user reports are generated for videos and comments containing user claims that need to be reviewed by moderators. The data team is tasked with developing a predictive model to streamline this process and improve efficiency in addressing user reports. The project proposal will outline milestones and tasks to achieve this goal.

### Data Understanding:
The data team at TikTok, led by experienced professionals, will work on understanding the dataset and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to determine the most useful information for the project. The team will also inspect the dataset for missing data and run statistical tests to further analyze the data.

### Modeling and Evaluation:
The main goal of the project is to build and deliver a reliable machine learning model for claims classification. The team will determine the type of regression model to use and conduct hypothesis testing on the dataset. The project will involve setting up a workflow and checking the assumptions made by the regression modeling.

### Conclusion:
The TikTok Claims Classification Project presents an opportunity for data analysts to collaborate with a talented team and make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company. By developing a predictive model for claims classification, TikTok aims to enhance the efficiency of addressing user reports and prioritize them effectively.
